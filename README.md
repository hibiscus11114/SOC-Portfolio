# Hi - I'm Yurii Kholmohorov
Cybersecurity Trainee focused on defensive security, log analysis, SIEM and incident triage. Building hands-on projects to prepare for SOC L1 roles.

## Goal
Open to remote/hybrid entry-level cybersecurity positions (SOC L1, internships, apprenticeships).

## What’s inside
Each project under `projects/` contains:

- `configs/` - configuration files used in the PoC (Sysmon, Splunk UF, Filebeat, Logstash, savedsearches.conf, etc.)
- `data/` - safe payloads, simulators and helper scripts used to generate test events
- `logs/` - sample logs or JSON exports used as evidence for the detection
- `queries/` - detection queries (SPL, KQL, Kibana DSL)  
- `reports/` - incident summaries, showing what was detected, timeline, key evidence and recommended next steps. 
- `screenshots/` - screenshots of ingestion, search results, dashboards, and alert triggers
- `README.md` - project description
- `REPRO.md` - short, runnable reproduction steps with exact commands
